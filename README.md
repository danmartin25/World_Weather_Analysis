# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to assist customers in choosing a vacation destination. In Weather_Database, we first collected data from different cities to have a list of places for customers to choose from using the Current Weather API from Open Weather. Then in Vacation_Search, we prompted customers to choose a temperature range and made a heatmap showing temperatures in different areas around the globe. Last in Vacation_Itinerary, we used the Google Maps Directions API to map a route between 4 different example destination locations and display hotel names with markers.
